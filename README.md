<!-- /retcomm-readme-metrics -->

Static recompilation of **WipEout** built on
[psxrecomp](https://github.com/mstan/psxrecomp) and
[recomp-ui](https://github.com/mstan/recomp-ui).

WipEout recompiled for modern systems using psxrecomp.

**BIOS:** SCPH-5552 (Europe) retail BIOS, 524288 bytes, SHA-256 `1faaa18fa820a0225e488d9f086296b8e6c46df739666093987ff7d8fd352c09`. Supply your own dump; releases do not use OpenBIOS.

## RetComM Launcher

You can run this title **standalone** (release zip + the built-in recomp-ui
Generate & Build flow), or manage installs, updates, ROM/BIOS wiring, and queued
builds more intuitively with
**[RetComM Launcher](https://github.com/TechnicallyComputers/RetComM-Launcher)** —
the Retro Compilation Manager hub for self-compiling recomps.

RetComM checks for updates, rebuilds with existing build data when possible,
uses the same platform build tools as per-title launchers, and automates
BIOS/ROM/save plumbing so you are not stuck repeating each game’s wizard by hand.

## Legal

You must own the original game. Disc images under `disc/` are gitignored and
must never be committed. Retail BIOS dumps are not redistributed. This title
requires a legal SCPH-5552 BIOS dump. OpenBIOS is not a qualified route.

The current package is not release-ready. The owned Track 01 identity did not
match the current Redump digest corpus. BIOS-stage audio is choppy, and FMVs
are not vertically centered. These gates must close before publication.

Project-owned files use `GPL-3.0-only`. This license does not cover psxrecomp,
recomp-ui, game data, generated retail code, artwork, names, or trademarks.
See `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` for the separate dependency licenses.

Default app icon: `assets/psxrecomp.ico` (and `.png` / `.svg`) — RetComM-themed controller mark from `psxrecomp/assets/`. Windows builds embed it via `APP_ICON`.

Optional box art under `launcher_assets/img/` may come from
[libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails)
(`Named_Boxarts`); see `BOXART_SOURCE.txt` when present.

## Quick start (dev)

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
./psxrecomp/tools/ci/build_emitters.sh
python3 psxrecomp/psxrecomp_cli.py generate \
  --config game.toml --project-root . --disc disc/<your>.cue
cmake -S . -B build-release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-release --target psx-runtime
```

Zip prefix for CI artifacts: `wipeout-recomp`.

## Symbols

Progressive map: `symbols.toml` → `python3 tools/sync_symbols.py` →
`psx_symbols.h` (`PSX_FN_*`). See `psxrecomp/docs/SYMBOLS.md`.

## Framework pins

Submodule gitlinks (`psxrecomp`, optional `recomp-ui`, nested `recomp-net`)
are authoritative. `framework_pins.txt` is an optional scaffold snapshot;
release CI logs SHAs with `record_pins.sh` but builds whatever the gitlinks
resolve to. Bump submodules deliberately — do not float on `main`/`master`
in release CI.

## About this project

These ports are developed by a hobbyist (a DevSecOps engineer, not a game
programmer) with substantial AI assistance. What keeps that honest: every
change is validated before it ships - boot gates, hardware-oracle A/B
comparisons (Beetle/DuckStation), deterministic replay probes, and a shared
findings registry that documents failures as carefully as successes. AI
writes most of the code; the evidence discipline decides what survives.
Bug reports welcome - expect them to be investigated the same way.

tl;dr AI writes the code, but I always test it myself before pushing

## v0.1.1 three-platform candidate

This candidate targets Windows x64, Linux x64, macOS ARM64, and macOS x64.
These setup packages require your legally owned game disc and a supported
regional retail BIOS. They remain unpublished until their exact package tests
and release authorization pass.
